# OpenQuanta Protocol
![OpenQuanta Banner](public/images/oqwhite.svg)
OpenQuanta is a decentralized protocol reimagining scientific publishing. By combining blockchain-native ownership, tokenized access, and transparent reputation mechanics, OpenQuanta empowers researchers to publish, monetize, and prove authorship without relying on legacy publishers.
## Vision
Create an open, market-driven ecosystem where knowledge is discoverable, authors retain value from their work, and reputation is verifiable. OpenQuanta aims to shift incentives toward rapid dissemination, reproducibility, and fair compensation for contributors.
## What we provide
- Authorship as on-chain ownership: Publications mint Authorship NFTs that represent provenance and entitlements.
- Pay-per-view and tokenized access: Readers and institutions access full texts using $QPT tokens, enabling granular monetization and new licensing models.
- Transparent reputation layer: Citations, reviews, and contribution metrics are recorded to form an immutable reputation score for authors and reviewers.
- Peer review as a DAO-driven process: Incentivized, accountable peer review recorded as verifiable digital assets.
- Liquid research assets: Research outputs can be traded, fractionally owned, or auctioned while preserving attribution.
## Key principles
- Author-first economics: Maximize revenue retention for creators while keeping access flexible.
- Verifiability: Make authorship, reviews, and citation histories auditable and tamper-resistant.
- Composability: Design research assets and reputation data to interoperate with DeFi, educational platforms, and institutional workflows.
- Inclusivity: Lower barriers for contributors worldwide by enabling micro-payments and modular access.
## Status & roadmap
OpenQuanta is actively in development. Core protocol concepts and a demo are available; further work focuses on blockchain integration (Solana / EVM), reputation tokenomics, and institutional tooling for bulk access and analytics.
